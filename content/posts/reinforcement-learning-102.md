# Introduction

What are discounted rewards. What is MDP. What is a policy. What is the goal of learning the agent. Start from evaluating a state. Then how to find a policy.)

# Q-Learning
A model-free environment. The value function applied to Q instead of V.

# SARSA

A model-free environment. The Q-learning that accounts for exploration.
